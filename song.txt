This is the kingdom, kingdom
This is the kingdom, kingdom
Everybody's building empires
Building walls high in the name of glory
Everybody's hanging high wires
It's a fine line, it's an age-old story

The first will be last
And the last will be kings
The small will be great
And the great will be weak
Everybody's building empires
But it's our time
